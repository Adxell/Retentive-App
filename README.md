# Retentive App

This project is a template web application created with React and Vite. It serves as a modern and fast foundation for developing interactive user interfaces.

## Project Description

"Retentive App" is an application that demonstrates a modern development setup using:
- **React**: to build the user interface.
- **Vite**: as an ultra-fast build tool and development server.
- **ESLint**: to ensure code quality and consistency.

The goal is to provide a solid starting point for any web project that requires high performance in both development and production.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Se recomienda la versi√≥n LTS)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (viene incluido con Node.js)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine. Replace `your-username/react-project.git` with the actual URL of your repository.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Adxell/Retentive-App.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:5173 (or the port Vite assigns) to view it in your browser. The page will reload automatically if you make changes to the code.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run lint`

Runs the linter (ESLint) to analyze the code for potential errors and style issues. It's good practice to run this command before committing your changes.

### `npm run preview`

Starts a local static server to preview the production build located in the `dist` folder.
